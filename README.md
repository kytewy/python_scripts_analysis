A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you communicate expectations for and manage contributions to your project.

A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:

This is a project is about how to develop

What the project does
Why the project is useful
How users can get started with the project
Where users can get help with your project
Who maintains and contributes to the project
