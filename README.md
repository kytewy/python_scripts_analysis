# ETL for Education 

# Background

Education plays an important role in society. Being more well educated has a number of benefits including financial, career, personal and societal.
Financial benefits can be found from balance sheets, income statements and adhere to governmental regulation which are published on a timely basis. Financial benefits are easier to quantify and compare, but it does not discount the value of the others. 
Where do we find the others?

How do we choose one benifit over another?

Difficult to directly quantify and make comparisons between non-financial benefits of education. Individuals with post-secondary education: 
- Less likely to smoke
- Lower rates of obesity
- Lower crime rates 
- More likely to report high life satisfaction.  

Would you rather live in a community with lower crime rates or lower levels of life satisfaction?

When do you need to see the benefits?

- Once you have the benefit, creating a time horizon in an investments gives you the ROI (Return on Investment).   
- Investing in a after-school program will yield benefits next year? 4 years?
- Balancing all four benefits do not trouble every financial manager, but do need to be taken into consideration as a public servant.
